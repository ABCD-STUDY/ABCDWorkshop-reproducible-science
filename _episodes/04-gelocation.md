### Geolocation derived sharing model in ABCD

Because of the known issues with sharing participant identifying information the ABCD study has started sharing of geolocation derived variables. Active participation of both ABCD internal investigators and external investigators are encouraged by this model. The Data Analysis and Informatics Center requests users to suggest and implement additional derived variables.
