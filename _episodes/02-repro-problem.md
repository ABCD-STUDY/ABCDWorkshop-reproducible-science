## A number of studies have brought the reproducibility of science into question.

### Prinz, et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 10, 712 (September 2011) Bayer Healthcare

### But just what is 'reproducibility' anyway?

* Re-executability (publication-level replication). The exact same data, operated on by the exact same analysis should yield the exact same result. This is currently a problem since publications, in order to maintain readability, do not typically provide complete specification of the analysis method or access to the exact data. 

* Generalizability: We can divide generalizability into three variations:

  * Generalization Variation 1: Exact Same Data + Nominally ‘Similar’ Analyses should yield a ‘Similar’ Result (i.e. FreeSurfer subcortical volumes compared to FSL FIRST)
   
  * Generalization Variation 2: Nominally ‘Similar’ Data + Exact Same Analysis should yield a ‘Similar’ Result (i.e. my kids with autism compared to your kids with autism)
   
  * Generalized Reproducibility: Nominally ‘Similar’ Data + Nominally ‘Similar’ Analyses should yield a ‘Similar’ Result
