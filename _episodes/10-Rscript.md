In order to support the open science initiative the DAIC provides full access to the behind the scenes analysis scripts that make DEAP possible. This exposes the core model setup as well as code that is used to parse the user interface and code that generates the graphical output. This workshop will show the basic structure of the downloadable script and highlight ways in which the code can be adjusted.
