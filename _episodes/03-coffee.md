Use the `break` layout to describe things you think people might want to
reflect on, or discuss among themselves during the breaks.

Best to do math during a break.

Delimiters [recognized by kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#math-blocks):

inline $$ \frac{kram}{down} \sum_0^\infty $$ text.

This seems to work:

$$ \frac{kram}{down} \sum_0^\infty $$

or 

$$ P( F(y) < t) ) = P( F^{-1}F(y) < F^{-1}(t) ) $$

The last two are display math because it occurs alone in a block.
