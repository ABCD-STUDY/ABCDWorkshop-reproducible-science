### The issues that can affect reproducibility include:
* Low power
* Mistakes
* Ineffective Data Sharing
* Methodological Variance
* Sampling
* P – hacking (P-phishing)
  * Definition...
* Publication Bias
  * Only reporting potentially significant results, and not the rest

### Emerging Solutions
* Low power –> **Better Data Sharing**
  * Special Issue on Neuroimaging Databases (Eickoff, et al, NeuroImage, 2016)
* Mistakes –> **Better Methods/Results ‘Publication’**
  * Workflow Specifications & Results Databases (i.e. NeuroVault)
* Methodological Variance –> **Better Methods Description/Methods Standardization**
  * Workflow Specifications & Standard Execution Environments
* P – hacking  –> **Analysis Pre-Registration**
  * For Example: Open Science Foundation
* Publication Bias –> **Results Databases**
  * Results Databases (i.e. NeuroVault)
